# Terminal Password Generator
## Functionality
The project creates a random password each time you run it. Picking characters
from an array, it randomizes and joins them into an array of fixed size (given 
by the user) to create the new password.

## Compiling & Running
To compile the project, you need to have g++ installed in your machine
and C++ (with the necessary libraries). 
```
g++ main.cpp -o password_generator
./password_generator
```
